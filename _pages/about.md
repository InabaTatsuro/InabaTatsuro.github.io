## About me

Hello, my name is Tatsuro Inaba.
I'm a 1st-year master's student at the [Speech and Audio Processing Lab](http://sap.ist.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/EN/) at Kyoto University, advised by [Kazuyoshi Yoshii](http://sap.ist.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/members/yoshii/) and [Eita Nakamura](https://eita-nakamura.github.io/index.html).

My research interests lie in symbolic music generation/understanding, relationship between music and text, and human centered music co-composition with AI.

I'm seeking a Ph.D. opportunity, aiming to enroll Fall 2025.
