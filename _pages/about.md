## Bio
Hello, my name is Tatsuro Inaba.
I'm currently a first-year master's student studying in the [Intelligence Science and Technology Course](https://www.ist.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/) at Kyoto University.
I belong to the [Speech and Audio Processing Lab](http://sap.ist.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/EN/), advised by [Kazuyoshi Yoshii](http://sap.ist.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/members/yoshii/) and [Eita Nakamura](https://eita-nakamura.github.io/index.html). I've recently been doing research related to symbolic music.


I'm especially interested in the following topics:
- Symbolic music generation with textual interaction
- Relationship between Music and Lyrics
- Application of NLP to Music
- Application of LLMs [[ACL2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16896)]


I'm seeking a Ph.D. opportunity, aiming to enroll Fall 2025.
