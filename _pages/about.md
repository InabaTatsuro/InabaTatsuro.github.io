Hello, my name is Tatsuro Inaba.
I'm currently a first-year master's student studying in the Intelligence Science and Technology Course at Kyoto University.
I belong to the [Speech and Audio Processing Lab](http://sap.ist.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/EN/), advised by [Kazuyoshi Yoshii](http://sap.ist.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/members/yoshii/) and [Eita Nakamura](https://eita-nakamura.github.io/index.html). I've recently been researching symbolic music infilling.

My research goal is to create an AI that can teach composition interactively.
While the idea of AI composing music is fascinating, I aspire to foster a world where people can learn about diverse music, such as foreign music, from AI and use this knowledge for rich self-expression.
I am committed to exploring what is truly essential when humans take the lead in composing.
Additionaly, I really enjoy playing the guitar and piano, as well as composing music.


I'm especially interested in the following topics:
- music generation/understanding
- Relationship between music and lyrics
- Regional and human characteristics represented by music
- Application of NLP technique [[ACL2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16896)]


I'm seeking a Ph.D. opportunity, aiming to enroll Fall 2025.
