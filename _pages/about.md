Hello, my name is Tatsuro Inaba. I'm currently a first-year master's student studying in the [Intelligence Science and Technology Course](https://www.ist.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/) at Kyoto University. I belong to the [Speech and Audio Processing Lab](http://sap.ist.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/EN/), advised by [Kazuyoshi Yoshii](http://sap.ist.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/members/yoshii/).

My research interest lies in the applications of Large Language Models and Symbolic Music Generation. In paticular, I've been deeply interested in the investigation of various extensions and learning methods that reflect a human perspective.

I'm planning to pursue a Ph.D., intending to enroll in 2025. However, I have yet to decide where I'll be taking.
