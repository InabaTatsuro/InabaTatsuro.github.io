## Bio
Hello, my name is Tatsuro Inaba. I'm currently a first-year master's student studying in the [Intelligence Science and Technology Course](https://www.ist.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/) at Kyoto University. I belong to the [Speech and Audio Processing Lab](http://sap.ist.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/EN/), advised by [Kazuyoshi Yoshii](http://sap.ist.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/members/yoshii/).

My research interest lies in the applications of **Large Language Models** and **Symbolic Music Generation**. In paticular, I've been deeply interested in the investigation of various extensions and learning methods that reflect a **human perspective** (e.g., Curriculum learning, External tools/knowledge).

I'm planning to pursue a Ph.D., intending to enroll in 2025. However, I have yet to decide where I'll be taking.
