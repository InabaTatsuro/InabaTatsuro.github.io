## Bio
Hello, my name is Tatsuro Inaba.
I'm currently a first-year master's student studying in the [Intelligence Science and Technology Course](https://www.ist.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/) at Kyoto University.
I belong to the [Speech and Audio Processing Lab](http://sap.ist.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/EN/), advised by [Kazuyoshi Yoshii](http://sap.ist.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/members/yoshii/).

Keywords: Music Information Retrieval, Natural Language Processing

I'm especially interested in the following topics:
- Symbolic Music Generation
- Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
- Knowledge Distillation
- Tool Augmented Language Model

I hope to create an AI that assists in difficult situations rather than taking away human pleasures.


I'm planning to pursue a Ph.D, intending to enroll in 2025.
